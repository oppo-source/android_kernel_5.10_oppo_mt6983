	  Enable this option if you want use ftrace for thermal
	  driver debugging on Mediatek platforms.
	  This driver creates trace points and a periodical timer
	  for network throughput calculation.

config MTK_THERMAL_IPI
	tristate "Mediatek thermal IPI interface driver"
	depends on MTK_TINYSYS_SSPM_SUPPORT || MTK_TINYSYS_MCUPM_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable this option if you want to use and communicate
	  with tinysys microprocessors for Mediatek platforms.
	  This driver defines thermal ipi commands and provides an
	  API to send a ipi command to tinysys microprocessors.

config MTK_THERMAL_INTERFACE
	tristate "Mediatek thermal interface driver"
