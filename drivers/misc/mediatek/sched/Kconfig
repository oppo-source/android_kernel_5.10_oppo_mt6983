config MTK_SCHEDULER
	tristate "mtk scheduler feature"
	help
	  Choose this option to enable mtk schduler feature.
	  These features include
		non-linear DVFS control
		EAS enhancement

config MTK_OPP_CAP_INFO
	bool "Per-opp capacity information"
	depends on MTK_CPUFREQ_SUGOV_EXT
	help
	  Choose this option to provide per-opp capacity API.
	  Scheduler module will get per-opp capacity from sram and
	  initialize opp capacity table. This config is used by
	  performance tuning framework and non-linear frequency control.

config NONLINEAR_FREQ_CTL
	bool "Non-linear frequency control"
	depends on MTK_OPP_CAP_INFO
	help
	  Choose this option to enable non-linear frequency control.
	  This will change per-opp capacity from linear scaled by
	  freuqency to evaluated by benchmark. This makes capacity
	  more accurate and will let scheduler/schedutil use more
	  suitable frequency.

config MTK_EAS
	bool "MTK EAS enhancement"
	depends on MTK_SCHEDULER
	help
	  MTK EAS enhancement features.
	  These featues include
	   1. load balance in the same frequency domain
	   2. hint aware in idle balance
	   3. Notify thermal ceiling to scheduler by reading thermal
		ceiling in SRAM and updating thermal pressure.

config MTK_THERMAL_AWARE_SCHEDULING
	bool "thermal aware scheduling"
	depends on MTK_EAS && MTK_THERMAL_INTERFACE
	help
	  CPU leakage optimization by temperature balance in the
	  same frequency domain.
	  Task placement consider temperature for leakage.
	  Use current Per-core temperature (per-10'c, per-die).
	  Favor tasks to CPU with lowest thermal pressure.

config MTK_LEAKAGE_AWARE_TEMP
	bool "MTK leakage aware temperature"
	depends on MTK_EAS &&  MTK_THERMAL_INTERFACE
	help
	  Compute energy will consider CPU leakage and
	  CPU leakage will aware per-CPU temperature.
	  Favor to put tasks into CPU with lowest temperature and
	  to save power.

config MTK_NEWIDLE_BALANCE
	bool "new idle balance for hint task"
	depends on MTK_EAS
	help
	  When a CPU is newly IDLE, pull the runnable task
	  with Latency-sensitive hint in other CPUs to this IDLE CPU.
	  This feature enhances the latency of the task with
	  latency-sensitive hint.

config MTK_CORE_PAUSE
	bool "core pause driver"
	depends on MTK_SCHEDULER
	help
	   Choose this option to provide core pause related API.
	   core pause intends to have a way to force a CPU to go idle
	   and to resume as quickly as possible, with as little
	   disruption as possible on the system.

config MTK_SCHED_BIG_TASK_ROTATE
	bool "scheduling big task rotate"
	depends on MTK_SCHEDULER
	help
	   Swap two misfit tasks between big cores and little core,
	   equally distributed runtime for each misfit task.
	   It can use for parallel thread at multi-core to reduce
	   execution time.

config MTK_CPUFREQ_SUGOV_EXT
	tristate "mediatek sugov governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ && SMP
	help
	   Choose this option to provide vendor cpufreq governor build
	   by mediatek. This governor support non-linear freq control and
	   vary optimizations. This config should be enable when
	   you want full mtk solution.

config MTK_OPP_MIN
	bool "mediatek sugov governor"
	depends on MTK_CPUFREQ_SUGOV_EXT && MTK_THERMAL_INTERFACE
	help
	   To improve critical task performance under same power budget
	   On-time deliver critical task frequency boost hint to thermal.

config MTK_CORE_CTL
	tristate "MTK Core Control with CPU Isolation"
	depends on MTK_CORE_PAUSE
	help
	  This config is for the core control policy with CPU isolation.
	  The core control online and offline CPU cores based on task
	  utilizations from scheduler information automatically.
	  If you are not sure about whether to enable it or not,
	  please set n.

config SCHEDUTIL_USE_TL
	bool "use target loads in schedutil governor"
	help
	  Add target_loads sysfs attr in cpufreq schedutil governor.
