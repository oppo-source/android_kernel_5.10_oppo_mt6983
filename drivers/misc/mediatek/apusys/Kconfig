config MTK_APUSYS_SUPPORT
	tristate "APUSYS driver"
	help
	  Enable Mediatek APUSYS feature for centralize control.
	  Middleware and APU scheduler will control memory,
	  QoS, and normal/deadline command queue in central layer.
	  Support multiple, multicore APU command scheduling and
	  execution in low level driver.

config MTK_APUSYS_DEBUG
	bool "APUSYS debug"
	depends on MTK_APUSYS_SUPPORT
	help
	  Enable debug facilities of APUSYS, including
	  trace points and trace tags. Recommended for
	  analysis resource issues, such as starvation.
	  Disable, if you don't need them.

config MTK_APUSYS_RT_SUPPORT
	bool "APUSYS Preemption"
	help
	  For Mediatek APUSYS preemption features.
	  This config will enable MDLA/VPU preemption feature.
	  It will increase performance for high priority task.
	  MDLA/VPU should be enable/disable at the same time.

config MTK_APUSYS_MDLA_SUPPORT
	bool "MDLA driver"
	help
	  Support deep neural network calculation using
	  hardware accelerator. Customers and third party
	  could use MDLA to develop feature and algorithm
	  by themselves.

config MTK_APUSYS_VPU
	bool "VPU driver"
	help
	  Support image processing using VPU hardware.
	  Customers and third party could use VPU to develop
	  feature and algorithm by themselves. There is better
	  performance and power if image process algorithm
	  land on VPU instead of CPU/GPU.

config MTK_VPU_SUPPORT
	bool "VPU Driver (Legacy)"
	select MTK_APUSYS_VPU
	help
	  Alias of MTK_APUSYS_VPU, used to support
	  platforms that were using vpu v2.0, v3.0 driver configs.
	  The VPU driver of APUSYS is backward compatible
	  to v2.0, v3.0 drivers.

config MTK_APUSYS_VPU_DEBUG
	bool "VPU Debug"
	depends on MTK_APUSYS_VPU
	help
	  Enable debug facilities of VPU, such as
	  kernel logs, register dumps, device logs,
	  VPU jtag functions, and MET trace.
	  Disable, if you don't need them.

config MTK_VPU_SUPPORT_DEBUG
	bool "VPU Debug (Legacy)"
	depends on MTK_VPU_SUPPORT
	select MTK_APUSYS_VPU_DEBUG
	help
	  Alias of MTK_APUSYS_VPU_DEBUG, used to support
	  platforms that were using vpu v2.0, v3.0 driver configs.
	  The VPU driver of APUSYS is backward compatible
	  to v2.0, v3.0 drivers.

config MTK_APUSYS_EDMA_SUPPORT
	bool "EDMA (External DMA) Driver"
	help
	  The purpose of Mediatek eDMA is performing
	  data transfer between external memory such as
	  DRAM/TCM, It will cooperate with MDLA. eDMA
	  support different modes for image process.
