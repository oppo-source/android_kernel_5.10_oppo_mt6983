config MTK_CLK_BUFFER
	tristate "MediaTek Clock Buffer Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Clock Buffer
	  driver, which support interface for  PMIC 26Mhz output to
	  other HW component such as BB_MD/WCN/NFC/RF/UFS.
	  It could also control FPM/LPM mode switch state.

config MTK_CLKBUF_BBLPM
	bool "MediaTek Clock Buffer BBLPM Mode Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Clock Buffer
	  BBLPM, which support PMIC 26Mhz output transfer to low
	  power mode, less accurate with power consumption.
	  But with restrict condition for some of  XO_BUFFER need to
	  be disabled.

config MTK_CLKBUF_NFC
	bool "MediaTek Clock Buffer NFC Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to support for MediaTek Clock Buffer XO_NFC,
	  which support PMIC 26Mhz output to NFC HW component. If
	  this config is not set, XO_NFC will be disabled when
	  driver is probed.

config MTK_CLKBUF
	tristate "Mediatek Clock Buffer Driver Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Select yes for Mediatek Clock Buffer driver support. The
	  driver support for SW debug control to DCXO which output
	  26MHz to other HW module such as BB_MD/WCN/NFC/RF/UFS etc.
	  Moreover, the driver also allowed user control FPM, BBLPM,
	  LPM DCXO mode.

config MTK_CLKBUF_V1
	bool "Mediatek Clock Buffer V1 Driver Support"
	depends on MTK_CLKBUF
	help
	  Select yes for Mediatek Clock Buffer driver V1 support.
	  The driver support for SW debug control for DCXO related
	  interfaces which control connsys, nfc interface for 26M
	  output.

config MTK_SRCLKEN_RC_V1
	bool "Mediatek SRCLKEN RC Support"
	depends on MTK_CLKBUF
	help
	  Select yes for Mediatek SRCLKEN RC HW module support. The
	  HW module for central manager control of DCXO HW output.
	  Moreover, it support finer control of DCXO to several
	  module such as Connsys can be divided to Wifi, BT, GPS etc.
