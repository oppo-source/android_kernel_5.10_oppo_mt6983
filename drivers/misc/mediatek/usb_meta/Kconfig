	  Say Y or M here if your system runs on MediaTek SoCs with
	  'Fast Meta' feature. The feature will generate a virtual comport
	  and that will make 'meta mode" connected faster.

	  If you don't know what this is, please say N.

	  Choose M here to compile this driver as a module, and it
	  will be called meta.ko.
