config MTK_IOMMU_MISC
	tristate "misc iommu driver for enhanced feature"
	depends on MTK_IOMMU
	help
	  Choose this option to enable mediatek misc iommu driver.
	  Misc iommu includes the enhanced features about iommu hardware.
	  For example, it can implement iommu secure driver for secure
	  feature or debug feature.

config MTK_IOMMU_MISC_DBG
	tristate "Enable Mediatek IOMMU debug feature"
	depends on MTK_IOMMU_MISC
	help
	  Choose this option to enable mediatek iommu debug driver.
	  According to the characteristic of hardware, we need to add
	  some debug information. For example translation fault, hardware
	  dump information and so on. In addition, for ion buffer, we can
	  use dma_buf information to monitor iova, but if user use
	  "dma_alloc_attrs" to allocate buffer, we can not monitor iova.
	  So we can use list to save all iova node and dump it.

config MTK_IOMMU_MISC_SECURE
	tristate "Enable Mediatek IOMMU secure feature"
	depends on MTK_IOMMU_MISC
	help
	  Choose this option to enable mediatek iommu secure driver. IOMMU
	  also can support transaction besides supporting normal transaction.
	  In iommu secure driver, we can implement IOMMU secure driver
	  initialization for MTEE and other requirements for secure mapping.
	  In addition, we also run iommu protected banks(bank1~bank3) probe
	  and link with mtk_iommu.

config MTK_IOMMU_MISC_TEST
	tristate "Enable Mediatek IOMMU test feature"
	depends on MTK_IOMMU_MISC
	help
	  Choose this option to enable mediatek iommu test driver.
	  The feature tests mtk iommu driver software flow whether it is
	  normal work. For example, reserve iova region test, create page
	  table test, allocation iova by iommu framework test, allocation
	  iova by dma-buf framework test and so on. We can need to ensure
	  MTK iommu driver is available before iommu's masters use it by
	  iommu test.

config MTK_IOMMU_DEBUG
	bool "Debugging log for Mediatek IOMMU"
	help
	  Select this to see the detailed log message that shows what
	  happens in the IOMMU driver.
	  If unsure, say N.
